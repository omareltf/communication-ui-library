# Rooms

Rooms controls which users can join room calls and what capabilties each user by assigning them roles.
Rooms controls which users can join an ACS call. Rooms also controls what capabilties each user has during an ACS call
by assigning them roles

Currently there are 3 pre-defined roles which are:

- Presenter
- Attendee
- Consumer

To learn more about the Rooms, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/rooms/room-concept)

## Examples

The need for a secure ACS call and role based access control apply in many common communication scenarios such as:

- virtual visits (1:1 interactions)
- online class rooms (larger groups)
- presentations
- court trials
- debates

## How does UI Library interact with Rooms

The UI Library helps Contoso create an end user experiences by providing a set of UI components or UI Composite experiences
to join a Rooms call.

Note: The UI Library is not for creating users, rooms, or adding users to rooms.

## Rooms and the UI Library in your architecture

The following diagram illustrates where Rooms and the UI Library will fit in your architecture.

To start a rooms call, first an ACS user need to be created. Learn more about this by using ACS identities [here](./?path=/docs/identity--page).
The Rooms Client is required to create a room and add users to that room with assigned roles. Here are some
[Rooms Client quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/rooms/get-started-rooms).
Once the user is added to the room, the user and their assigned role (which can also be retrieved from the Rooms Client) are passed to Call Composite.

Note: In the future, the role may be automatically obtained by the Call Composite based on the user. So passing the role to the Call Composite
may no longer be needed.

## How to incorporate Rooms in your experience.

The following is a code snippet of how to connect the Call Composite to a rooms call.

Also, you can to try this <a href="./?path=/story/composites-call-joinexistingcall--join-existing-call" target="_blank">preview sample</a> to join
an existing room call by entering a roomId in the `Call locator` control.

## FAQs

### Can the UI Library help me create a room?

No, the UI Library only allows a known user to join a room they have been already added too. The Rooms Client is responsible for creating a room.
We have [quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/rooms/get-started-rooms) to allow you to create a
room and add that user to the room.

### Can the UI Library help me get a known user to join a room?

No, that is out of scope of the UI Library. We have an identity
[quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azcli#create-an-identity-and-issue-an-access-token-in-the-same-request)
to create a new user.

### Can the UI Library help me update the role of a participant?

No, this is done using the Rooms Client. The Javascript implementation can be imported from this
[repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/communication/communication-rooms/).

### How come some of my buttons are greyed out when I am using the UI composite in the Room?

Depending on your role we only support a subset of capabilities (E.g a presenter should be able to share their screen
but an attendee should not). You can review the predefined roles and permissions in this
[table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/rooms/room-concept#predefined-participant-roles-and-permissions).

### Is Rooms ready for production loads?

Currently Rooms and the UI Library support for rooms are both in public preview. We definitely look forward to seeing how you
like this experience so we can create an amazing experience when the feature goes "General Available" in 2023.

### If I have found any issues with the CallComposite when interacting with a Room where can I go?

Feel free to log a [Github issue](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/issues) and someone from our team can work with you on your issue.
